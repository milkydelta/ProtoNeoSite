layout: categories
# I removed the categories tab, which also removed the page at /categories/. The /categories/whatever/ pages still exist.
# I link to those /cat.../.../ pages for several things, but those pages have backlinks to /categories/. That's fine on local builds,
# but the GitHub Actions checker isn't happy with internal links to pages that don't exist. I'm adding this in to make the builds work.
