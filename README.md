# MD's New AniSoc Website

Not Official

My non-weekend weekend project to make a new version of the University of Nottingham Anime Society's website.

The old version of the society website was made with a program called Mobirise. None of the current folks are interested in installing and learning that, and I don't blame them. That also means the website gets forgotten, like it did earlier this year, when the domain wasn't renewed. Lots of society communication happens on the Discord and via Instagram, but there's still reasons to keep around a website.

CS students are not a majority of members, so the best way forward is to make editing the site easy for non-technical people. Markdown is designed to fix that exact problem, and Jekyll powers thousands of blogs, many of which are not written by CS folks.








## Acknowledgments

Website made with Jekyll and the Chirpy Theme.

This repository was made from the chirpy-starter template. That is under the MIT license, which can be found in `LICENSE-chirpy`. The original readme can be found at `README-chirpy.md`.

`_data/locales/en.yml` was taken from the main chirpy repository and modified.

`_includes/committee.html` and `_includes/events-list.html` are based on `_layouts/home.html` from the main chirpy repository.


This site might use images and text copied/imported wholesale from the old site. For that site, I have to thank all of the contributors: @Fraetor, @TheBlitzNexus, @NibNobNeb, @Lenkin1, and @WillTheCommsOfficer. In cases where I can tag a post with an author, if that text is primarily imported, I leave the author as the default, which is currently "AnimeSoc Nottingham".

This site will have copies of all previous Zine releases. Each release contains information about it's contributors. I'd like to thank all of those people. I haven't read many of them, but the ones I have read are excellent.
