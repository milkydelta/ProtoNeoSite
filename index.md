We are the University of Nottingham's resident Anime Society; bringing together fans of anime, manga and all Japanese otaku media.

We exist to serve as a place for anime fans to provide our members with anime throughout the year and to make a place to meet others with the similar interest through our organised events.

Whatever your interests are and whatever your taste is, be it weeaboo greenhorn or seasoned otaku, we encourage you to come along and make your after-school anime club dreams come true!
